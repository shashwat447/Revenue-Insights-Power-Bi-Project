### Business Problem

AtliQ Grands, a long-standing player in the hospitality industry with several five-star hotels in India, is facing challenges in maintaining market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. The management recognizes the need for strategic measures to counter competitors' moves and improve decision-making. To achieve this, the managing director intends to leverage "Business and Data Intelligence."
## Solving Approach
## Step 1: Defining the Metric List

I reviewed the sample data and understood the specific business objectives of AtliQ Grands. Based on this, I created a comprehensive list of relevant metrics that helped in analyzing their revenue and market share performance. The metric list provided earlier served as a starting point.
I identified several key performance indicators (KPIs) specific to the hotel business that would be valuable for AtliQ Grands to track and analyze. These KPIs include:

Occupancy Rate: The percentage of hotel rooms occupied over a specific period, indicating how well the hotel is utilizing its available rooms.

Average Daily Rate (ADR): The average price of rooms sold in a day, reflecting the hotel's pricing strategy and revenue generation.

Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR): Total room revenue divided by the total number of available rooms, showing the hotel's overall room revenue performance.
## Step 2: Creating the Dashboard

Using the sample data and the mock-up dashboard provided by stakeholders, I designed and developed a visually appealing and user-friendly dashboard. The dashboard incorporated the key metrics identified earlier and any other relevant insights.

## Step 3: Data Analysis and Insights

I conducted in-depth data analysis using the historical data provided. My aim was to extract meaningful insights that went beyond the metrics listed or displayed in the mock-up dashboard. These insights helped AtliQ Grands understand their business performance better and make data-driven decisions to improve market share and revenue.

Examples of additional insights I derived from the data included:

Geographic Performance: I analyzed the revenue and market share across different cities or regions to identify areas of growth or decline.
Guest Segmentation: I classified guests based on demographics, preferences, or spending patterns to personalize marketing efforts and services.
Demand Patterns: I identified seasonal or cyclical trends in bookings to optimize pricing and resource allocation.
Competitor Analysis: I compared the performance of AtliQ Grands with key competitors to gain a competitive edge and identify areas for improvement.
Customer Lifetime Value: I calculated the lifetime value of customers to focus on retaining high-value guests.
Online Reputation Analysis: I analyzed online reviews and ratings to gauge customer sentiment and identify areas for improvement.
## Step 4: Presenting the Insights
I prepared a comprehensive report summarizing the key metrics, the dashboard I created, and the additional insights derived from the data analysis. I presented these findings to the revenue management team and the managing director of AtliQ Grands. Using visualizations and clear explanations, my goal was to facilitate better understanding and informed decision-making.

By providing valuable data-driven insights, I aimed to assist AtliQ Grands in formulating effective strategies to regain market share and increase revenue in the luxury/business hotels category.
